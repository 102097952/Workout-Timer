# Workout-Timer
The Workout Timer app is an exercise tool, designed to help track and progress exercise routines and workouts.
The app lets the user create their own personal workouts, tracks progress of their exercise, even while the phone is asleep, and sends notifications for break times, and when the exercise is complete. 
 
This project was developed back in 2019 as a custom Android application. It was submitted for a mobile application unit I was undertaking during my university degree.
 
# Requirements
To start the server, you need: 
- Latest Version of Android Studio
 
An Android phone is not required to run this application, as Android Studio defaultly comes with Android emulators.
 
If you own an Android phone and wish to try it out, you can enable developer options in you phones settings, and connect it to your computer running Android Studio.
